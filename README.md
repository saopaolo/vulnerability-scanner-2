# vulnerability-scanner-2
Python script that uses the CVE database API from the NVD to check for vulnerabilities related to a specific website.  Please use responsibly. 

This example utilizes the requests library to make API calls and the BeautifulSoup library to crawl the website.

Please ensure you have beautifulsoup installed:

//pip install requests beautifulsoup4

Explanation

    Crawling the Website: The crawl_website function extracts all links from the given base URL. It uses a breadth-first search method to visit links and avoid revisiting.

    Fetching CVEs: The get_cves_for_product function queries the NVD API to retrieve CVEs related to the extracted product name (derived from the website URL).

    Main Function: The check_website_vulnerabilities function combines both parts. It first crawls the website for links and then searches for related vulnerabilities using the product name.

Usage

Replace https://example.com in the website_to_check variable with the actual website URL you want to check.
Note

    Make sure to adhere to the terms of service of the websites you crawl.
    This is a basic implementation; you may need to enhance and customise accordingly.
